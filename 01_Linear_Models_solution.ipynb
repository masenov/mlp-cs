    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is about linear transforms - a basic building block of neural networks, including deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Virtual environments and syncing repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you proceed onwards, remember to activate you virtual environments so you can use the software you installed last week as well as run the notebooks in interactive mode, not through the github.com website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "   * If you were in last week's Tuesday or Wednesday group type `activate_mlp` or `source ~/mlpractical/venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "   * If you were in the Monday group:\n",
    "      + and if you have chosen the **comfy** way type: `workon mlpractical`\n",
    "      + and if you have chosen the **generic** way, `source` your virutal environment using `source` and specyfing the path to the activate script (you need to localise it yourself, there were not any general recommendations w.r.t dir structure and people have installed it in different places, usually somewhere in the home directories. If you cannot easily find it by yourself, use something like: `find . -iname activate` ):\n",
    "\n",
    "## On Synchronising repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the git mlp repository you set up last week (i.e. `~/mlpractical/repo-mlp`) and once you sync the repository (in one of the two below ways, or look at our short Git FAQ <a href=\"https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/gitFAQ.md\">here</a>), start the notebook session by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ipython notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default way\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid potential conflicts between the changes you have made since last week and our additions, we recommend `stash` your changes and `pull` the new code from the mlpractical repository by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `git stash save \"Lab1 work\"`\n",
    "2. `git pull`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if you need to, you can always (temporaily) restore a desired state of the repository (look <a href=\"https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/gitFAQ.md\">here</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Otherwise** you may also create a branch for each lab separately (again, look <a href=\"https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/gitFAQ.md\">here</a> and git tutorials we linked there), this will allow you to keep `master` branch clean, and pull changes into it every week from the central repository. At the same time branching gives you much more flexibility with changes you introduce to the code as potential conflicts will not occur until you try to make an explicit merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For advanced github users\n",
    "\n",
    "It is OK if you want to keep your changes and merge the new code with whatever you already have, but you need to know what you are doing and how to resolve conflicts.\n",

    "### Note on storing matrices in computer memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider you want to store the following array in memory: $\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n",
    "7 & 8 & 9 \\end{array} \\right]$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In computer memory the above matrix would be organised as a vector in either (assume you allocate the memory at once for the whole matrix):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Row-wise layout where the order would look like: $\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n",
    "1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{array} \\right ]$\n",
    "* Column-wise layout where the order would look like: $\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n",
    "1 & 4 & 7 & 2 & 5 & 8 & 3 & 6 & 9 \\end{array} \\right ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although `numpy` can easily handle both formats (possibly with some computational overhead), in our code we will stick with modern (and default) `c`-like approach and use row-wise format (contrary to Fortran that used column-wise approach). \n",
    "\n",
    "This means, that in this tutorial:\n",
    "* vectors are kept row-wise $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_1, \\ldots, x_D) $ (rather than $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_1, \\ldots, x_D)^T$)\n",
    "* similarly, in case of matrices we will stick to: $\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc}\n",
    "x_{11} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{1D} \\\\\n",
    "x_{21} & x_{22} & \\ldots & x_{2D} \\\\\n",
    "x_{31} & x_{32} & \\ldots & x_{3D} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]$ and each row (i.e. $\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{11} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{1D} \\end{array} \\right]$) represents a single data-point (like one MNIST image or one window of observations)\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture slides you will find the equations following the conventional mathematical column-wise approach, but you can easily map them one way or the other using using matrix transpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear and Affine Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis of all linear models is so called affine transform, that is a transform that implements some linear transformation and translation of input features. The transforms we are going to use are parameterised by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Weight matrix $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D\\times K}$: where element $w_{ik}$ is the weight from input $x_i$ to output $y_k$\n",
    "  * Bias vector $\\mathbf{b}\\in R^{K}$ : where element $b_{k}$ is the bias for output $k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the bias is simply some additve term, and can be easily incorporated into an additional row in weight matrix and an additinal input in the inputs which is set to $1.0$ (as in the below picture taken from the lecture slides). However, here (and in the code) we will keep them separate.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Making Predictions](res/singleLayerNetWts-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, for the above example of 5-dimensional input vector by $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$, weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}=\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "w_{11} & w_{12} & w_{13} \\\\\n",

Modify `MetOfficeDataProvider` (for example, inherit from MetOfficeDataProvider to create a new class MetOfficeDataProviderBin) and modify `next()` function so it returns as `targets` either 0 (sunny - if the the amount of rain [before mean/variance normalisation] is equal to 0 or 1 (rainy -- otherwise).\n",
