    "# Coursework #1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework is concerned with building multi-layer networks to address the MNIST digit classification problem. It builds on the previous labs, in particular [02_MNIST_SLN.ipynb](02_MNIST_SLN.ipynb) in which single layer networks were trained for MNIST digit classification.   The course will involve extending that code to use Sigmoid and Softmax layers, combining these into multi-layer networks, and carrying out a number of MNIST digit classification experiments, to investigate the effect of learning rate, the number of hidden units, and the number of hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coursework is divided into 4 tasks:\n",
    "* **Task 1**:   *Implementing a sigmoid layer* - 15 marks.  \n",
    "This task involves extending the `Linear` class in file `mlp/layers.py` to `Sigmoid`, with code for forward prop, backprop computation of the gradient, and weight update.\n",
    "* **Task 2**:  *Implementing a softmax layer* - 15 marks.  \n",
    "This task involves extending the `Linear` class in file `mlp/layers.py` to `Softmax`, with code for forward prop, backprop computation of the gradient, and weight update.\n",
    "* **Task 3**:  *Constructing a multi-layer network* - 40 marks.  \n",
    "This task involves putting together a Sigmoid and a Softmax layer to create a multi-layer network, with one hidden layer (100 units) and one output layer, that is trained to classify MNIST digits.  This task will include reporting classification results, exploring the effect of learning rates, and plotting Hinton Diagrams for the hidden units and output units.\n",
    "* **Task 4**:  *Experiments with different architectures*  - 30 marks.  \n",
    "This task involves further MNIST classification experiments, primarily looking at the effect of using different numbers of hidden layers.\n",
    "The coursework will be marked out of 100, and will contribute 30% of the total mark in the MLP course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Previous Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this coursework make sure that you have completed the first three labs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [00_Introduction.ipynb](00_Introduction.ipynb) - setting up your environment; *Solutions*: [00_Introduction_solution.ipynb](00_Introduction_solution.ipynb)\n",
    "* [01_Linear_Models.ipynb](01_Linear_Models.ipynb) - training single layer networks; *Solutions*: [01_Linear_Models_solution.ipynb](01_Linear_Models_solution.ipynb)\n",
    "* [02_MNIST_SLN.ipynb](02_MNIST_SLN.ipynb) - training a single layer network for MNIST digit classification\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that your virtual environment is correct, please see [this note](https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/kernel_issue_fix.md) on the GitHub.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this task you need to create a class `Sigmoid` which encapsulates a layer of sigmoid units.  You should do this by extending the `mlp.layers.Linear` class (in file `mlp/layers.py`), which implements a a layer of linear units (i.e. weighted sum plus bias).  The `Sigmoid` class extends this by applying the sigmoid transfer function to the weighted sum in the forward propagation, and applying the derivative of the sigmoid in the gradient descent back propagation and computing the gradients with respect to layer's parameters. Do **not** copy the implementation provided in `Linear` class but rather, **reuse** it through inheritance.\n",
